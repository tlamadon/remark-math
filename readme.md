# remark-math

This is a fork of remark-math version 3.0.1 to work with current mdx plugins.

I have made only minor modifications, basically inline math gets converted to a math element that can later be processed with the MDX provider.

Here is the main [remark-math](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math) npm package.
